## Installation ðŸ—¹

### Using `pipx` to Install (preferred)

This package _could_ be installed using pip like any other Python package (in
fact, see the section below this one for instructions on how to do just that).
Given that we only need this package's entry points, however, we recommend that
[pipx][11] be used instead:

```shell
# install and setup pipx
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# install bugyi.tools
pipx install bugyi.tools
```

### Using `pip` to Install

To install `bugyi.tools` using [pip][9], run the following
commands in your terminal:

``` shell
python3 -m pip install --user bugyi.tools  # install bugyi.tools
```

If you don't have pip installed, this [Python installation guide][10] can guide
you through the process.
